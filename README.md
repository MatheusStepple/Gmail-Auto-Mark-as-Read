# Gmail Auto Mark as Read

The application uses `pyautogui` for GUI automation, `webbrowser` to open Gmail, and `plyer` to provide notifications. It runs in the background and allows you to trigger the email marking process by pressing the `F12` key. A notification is displayed to inform you when the inbox is cleaned.

- **Press `F12`**: To trigger the email marking process.
- **Press `ESC`**: To exit the application.

- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Configured to execute the email cleaning task when the `F12` key is pressed.
- **Background Operation**: Runs in the background without requiring continuous user interaction.
